# Pricing for AI Prank Call App

This application is free to use, but it makes use of the Twilio API, which is a paid service. The cost of using the Twilio API depends on the number and duration of the calls you make. Please refer to the [Twilio Pricing Page](https://www.twilio.com/pricing) for more details.

In addition, you will need to host the audio file used in the prank call on a server, which may also incur costs depending on the hosting service you use.
